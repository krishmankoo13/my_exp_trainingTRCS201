## My experience in 3rd semester training at GNDEC ludhiana
## DAY 1:
### Orientation
The day started with our introduction to our core department - Computer Science and Engineering. Dr Priyanka introduced us with our department and Dr Kiran Jyoti(HOD CSE department) gave us a brief overview about our syllabus scheme.After that we were escorted to our respective labs.
### Learning about Fundamnetals of linux
Our lab professor then gave us a brief introduction about linux and how to download it. She helped us understand the applications of it and told us how we can apply it in our future fields.I came to know that linux is used in big companies as it is more secure & open source.We were motivated to also go for startups and other companies along with our studies.It reaally motivated me alot and was more curious about the upcoming days of training as there is are a lot of things for me to learn.

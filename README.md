# My Experience in Summer Training by Krish Mankoo
## In this repositry I will share my Experience in 3rd semester training at GNDEC ludhiana
## DAY 1:
### Orientation
The day started with our introduction to our core department - Computer Science and Engineering. Dr Priyanka introduced us with our department and Dr Kiran Jyoti(HOD CSE department) gave us a brief overview about our syllabus scheme.After that we were escorted to our respective labs.

### Learning about Fundametals of linux
Our lab professor then gave us a brief introduction about linux and how to download it.To download linux we required Oracle Virtual Box,Visual C++ Redistribuable Version and Ubuntu Desktop LTS. She helped us understand the applications of it and told us how we can apply it in our future fields.I came to know that linux is used in big companies as it is more secure & open source.We were motivated to also go for startups and other companies along with our studies.I got to know the difference between service-based companies and product-based companies.

After we were explained about booting and its types.Booting, in the context of computers, refers to the process of starting up a computer and loading the operating system.It has two types Cold Boot(eg- Linux and MacOS) and Warm Boot(eg- Windows).After we revised the concepts ourself.We also learned about dual boot which Dual allows you to install two operating systems on the same machine, and choose which one to use at startup.

While starting the virtual machine we had to partition our system and then we were introduced with the concept of partitioning.Partitioning splits your hard drive into separate sections (partitions) for better organization.There are two types: MBR(Master Boot Record) and GPT(Guided Partition Table).MBR is the older partitioning system, used since the early days of PCs. On the other hand GPT is the modern replacement for MBR, part of the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) system.

It really motivated and inspired me alot and I was more curious about the upcoming days of training as there are a lot of things for me to learn.

## DAY 2:
 Our day started today at 8:30 a.m with a positive mindset and a desire to learn something new.
*“The future belongs to those who prepare for it today.”*
With this thought, we stepped into our labs, ready to absorb and explore the tech world further.
### Kernal and Shell
We were introduced to the core components of the Linux operating system — the Kernel and the Shell.

The Kernel is the heart of the operating system. It directly interacts with the hardware and manages system resources like CPU, memory, and devices. It ensures that each process and application gets the required time and resources to function properly.

The Shell is the interface between the user and the kernel. It interprets the commands we type and communicates them to the kernel.There are four types of shell-Bash,Sh,Zsh and Fish.But in this training session we used Bash shell.Also there are two types of categories- Command Line Shells and Graphical Shells

### File System Structures
The Linux file system is structured hierarchically, starting from a root directory denoted by /.

### Commands in Linux
The most fun part of today was learning commands in Linux.We learned a lot of basic commands today and had hand's on practice too.Multiple errors also occured but solving them was fun and challenging too.
### Types of Command
- whoami- Returns the current domain and user name.
  
- date- Returns current date.

- ls (list)- Returns content of a specified Directory

- cd- Changes directory.

- mkdir- Creates a new directory.

- pwd- Prints the current working directory.

- touch- Creates empty file.

- cat- Creates file with content.

- whereis- Finds the location of specified file.

- cp- To copy content of a file to the other.

- mv- To move or rename a file.

- whatis- Gives short description of a command.

  The screenshots of the commands I practiced are below.

## DAY 3:
On the third day, We first had our viva for day1 and day2.

### File and Directory Permissions
- chmod (change mode):  It is used to change the access permissions of files and directories.
Some of its types are:

| Syntax                | Meaning                                                       |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `chmod +x filename.sh`  | Gives permission to **run** the script (makes it executable). |
| `chmod 444 filename.sh` | Sets file to **read-only** for everyone.                     |
| `chmod 644 filename.sh` | Gives **read/write** to the owner, **read-only** to others.  |


- chown (change owner ): It is used to **change the ownership** of files and directories.

Some of its types are:

| Type                           | Meaning                                      | Syntax Example                          |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Change Owner                   | Changes only the user (owner)                | `chown krish file.txt`                  |
| Change Owner and Group         | Changes user and group                       | `chown krish:developers file.txt`       |
| Change Only Group              | Use empty owner before `:`                   | `chown :developers file.txt`            |
| Recursive Ownership Change     | Applies changes to all sub-files and folders | `chown -R krish:devs foldername/`       |


### Redirection

Redirection in Linux is used to **send output to files**, **take input from files**, or **append data** instead of showing it on the screen.

| Type | Meaning                        | Syntax & Example                    |
|------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `>`  | Write/overwrite to a file      | `echo hi > file.txt`                |
| `>>` | Append to a file               | `echo hi >> file.txt`               |
| `<`  | Input redirection (read from a file) | `sort < file.txt`             |

### PIPES

The **pipe** symbol (`|`) is used to **connect multiple commands**, where the **output of one command becomes the input of the next**.  
It is commonly used for **filtering and processing data** in a single line.

## DAY 5:

## Common PC Problems and Solutions

Help Shortcut:
Press F1 to open help tool in Windows.

Today we learned about common issues encountered on personal computers and how to fix them. Each point includes both the cause and the recommended solution.

### PC Maintenance Issues

- **C Drive Full or Slowing Down**  
  The C drive stores essential system files. Avoid saving personal files here. Free space using Disk Cleanup, uninstall unused programs, or move data to D or E drive. You can also delete temporary files using `%temp%`.

- **PC Running Slowly**  
  Caused by too many background processes or lack of memory. Open Task Manager to disable startup apps, delete temp files, and remove unused software.

- **Fragmented Hard Drive (HDD only)**  
  Fragmentation slows down file access. Use "Defragment and Optimize Drives" in Windows to improve speed (note: not needed for SSDs).

- **Too Many Temporary or Junk Files**  
  These files build up from software usage. Use Disk Cleanup or manually delete files from `%temp%`, `temp`, and `prefetch` folders.

- **System Takes Long to Start**  
  Caused by unnecessary startup programs and services. Disable unwanted startup applications using Task Manager under the "Startup" tab.

### Software & Application Issues

- **Software Freezes or Crashes**  
  Can happen due to corrupted installations or insufficient RAM. Force quit using Task Manager and reinstall or update the app.

- **Software Installation Fails**  
  Common reasons include lack of admin permissions or incompatible versions. Use "Run as administrator" and ensure correct 32/64-bit installer is downloaded.

- **Windows Update Not Working**  
  Sometimes the update cache is corrupted. Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter or delete contents in `C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution` folder.

### Hardware & Peripheral Issues

- **Printer Not Responding**  
  Usually caused by driver problems or connection issues. Restart the printer and PC, check cable or network, and reinstall drivers if needed.

- **Drive Not Detected**  
  A new or unformatted drive won’t show in Explorer. Go to Disk Management, assign it a drive letter, and format if necessary.

- **Computer Automatically Restarts or Overheats**  
  Often caused by clogged fans or poor airflow. Clean the dust from CPU fan, vents, and use cooling pads for laptops. Also check if thermal paste needs reapplying.

### Network & Security Issues

- **Internet Not Working Despite Being Connected**  
  Likely a DNS or driver issue. Restart the router, run Windows Network Troubleshooter, or open Command Prompt and run `ipconfig /flushdns`.

- **Antivirus Slowing Down the System**  
  Heavy or multiple antivirus programs can reduce speed. Use only one trusted antivirus (like Windows Defender), and disable unnecessary real-time scanning features.

### Account & Graphics Issues

- **Forgotten Login Password**  
  For local accounts, use Safe Mode or reset via another admin account. For Microsoft accounts, reset using Microsoft’s online password recovery.

- **Low Graphics Performance**  
  Happens due to outdated GPU drivers or background apps using resources. Download latest drivers from NVIDIA/AMD and close all unnecessary apps during usage.

##  What is Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)?

The **Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)** is a critical system error screen displayed by Windows when the operating system can no longer operate safely due to a severe issue. It is also called a **Stop Error** or **bug check**.

![imagealt](https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/a75db4f15b0c02ccde4100ed1e26b9606557080a/hub/2025/06/26/f9a73c79-3ee4-4fab-b23a-e6fd8833cee0/blue-screen-of-death-gettyimages-1328389388-1.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200)
###  Why Does BSOD Happen?

BSOD typically occurs due to:

- **Faulty device drivers** (graphics, network, etc.)
- **Corrupted system files**
- **Faulty or incompatible hardware** (RAM, hard drive, GPU)
- **Overheating or power issues**
- **Malware affecting system-level processes**
- **Overclocking or BIOS misconfigurations**
- **Critical kernel or memory management errors**

---

###  How to Analyze a BSOD?

1. **Read the Error Message**  
   The BSOD screen will display a `STOP CODE` like:  
   `DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL` or `CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED`.

2. **Use Reliability Monitor**  
   Open `Reliability Monitor` (search in Start menu) to check system events before the crash.

3. **View Dump File**
   After a BSOD, Windows creates a dump file that records what happened before the crash.
   Analyze crash dumps stored at:  
   `C:\Windows\Minidump\` using tools like:
   - **BlueScreenView** (NirSoft)
   - **WinDbg** (Microsoft Debugger)
   - **WhoCrashed**

4. **Event Viewer**  
   Use `eventvwr.msc` to see system logs and warnings before the BSOD occurred.


### Solutions to Fix BSOD

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
|  1. **Update Drivers** | Go to Device Manager and update all major drivers (especially GPU, chipset, and network). |
|  2. **Uninstall Recent Software** | Remove any software or drivers recently installed before the BSOD started. |
|  3. **Run System File Checker** | Run `sfc /scannow` in Command Prompt as administrator to repair corrupted system files. |
| 4. **Check RAM** | Run **Windows Memory Diagnostic** to check for faulty memory. |
|  5. **Scan for Malware** | Use Windows Defender or Malwarebytes to check for deep infections. |
| 6. **Reset Overclocking** | If using overclocked settings, restore BIOS/UEFI to default values. |
|  7. **Perform a System Restore** | Roll back to a working system point using System Restore. |
|  8. **Update Windows** | Keep the OS up to date with the latest security and stability patches. |

### Preventive Measures

- Avoid installing untrusted drivers or registry cleaners.
- Keep a restore point or full backup before major updates.
- Ensure proper cooling and power supply to prevent hardware issues.

##  Assignment on BIOS/UEFI Settings and POST Errors

### What is BIOS/UEFI?

- **BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)** and **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)** are low-level firmware interfaces between the computer's hardware and its operating system.
- BIOS is the **older** system, while UEFI is the **modern standard** in most PCs since 2010.
- These interfaces allow you to configure hardware settings, boot order, security options, and more.

### Common BIOS/UEFI Settings

| Setting | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Boot Order** | Determines which device (HDD, SSD, USB) the PC checks first when starting. |
| **Secure Boot** | Prevents unauthorized OS or bootloaders from loading (enabled in UEFI). |
| **Virtualization** | Enables support for virtual machines (VT-x, AMD-V). |
| **XMP/DOCP Profile** | Enables full-speed RAM performance (must be manually enabled in some PCs). |
| **Fan Control** | Sets custom cooling profiles based on temperature. |
| **Date/Time** | Sets the system clock — affects OS time if incorrect. |
| **SATA Mode** | Selects IDE, AHCI, or RAID for hard drive behavior. |
| **Integrated Peripherals** | Enables/disables onboard devices (e.g., audio, LAN, USB ports). |
| **Password Setup** | Sets BIOS or boot passwords for security. |

### What is POST?

**POST (Power-On Self Test)** is a diagnostic process run by BIOS/UEFI during startup to check if essential hardware (CPU, RAM, GPU, keyboard, etc.) is working.

If POST fails, it usually halts the boot process and gives error **beeps or messages**.

### Common POST Errors & Beep Codes

| Error / Beep | Meaning | Suggested Fix |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| **No Display / Blank Screen** | GPU or RAM issue | Reseat graphics card and RAM |
| **Continuous Beeps** | RAM failure | Check RAM sticks or try different slots |
| **1 Long, 2 Short Beeps** | GPU not detected | Reinsert GPU properly or test another |
| **Keyboard Not Detected** | Faulty or unplugged keyboard | Try another USB port or replace keyboard |
| **CMOS Checksum Error** | BIOS settings corrupt | Reset BIOS using Clear CMOS jumper |
| **Date and Time Reset** | CMOS battery drained | Replace the small coin-cell battery on motherboard |

> Beep codes vary by **BIOS manufacturer** (AMI, Phoenix, Award). Refer to your motherboard manual for exact beep meanings.


### How to Access BIOS/UEFI

- Restart your PC and press the correct key during startup:  
  - **DEL** or **F2** (common for most desktops/laptops)  
  - **ESC**, **F1**, or **F10** for others  
- You may also access UEFI through Windows:
  - Go to **Settings > Update & Security > Recovery > Advanced Startup > Restart Now > UEFI Firmware Settings**


### Resetting BIOS/UEFI to Default

If you misconfigured a setting or can’t boot:

- Enter BIOS/UEFI → Choose **"Load Setup Defaults"** or **"Reset to Default"**
- Or remove the CMOS battery for a few minutes and reinsert it
- Or use the **Clear CMOS jumper** on the motherboard

### Crimping Basics

Crimping is the process of attaching an RJ45 connector to the end of a network cable.

**Steps:**
1. Strip about 1 inch of outer cable jacket.
2. Untwist and arrange the wires in the correct color order.
3. Trim all wires to the same length.
4. Insert wires into the RJ45 connector.
5. Use a crimping tool to lock the connector in place.

---

### Cable Testing

After crimping, a cable tester is used to check:

- Proper pin connections (1 to 1, 2 to 2, etc.)
- Continuity across all 8 wires
- No shorts, opens, or miswiring

A basic tester will light up each pin in sequence to show a successful connection.

## What is Networking?
Networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices together to share resources, data, and applications. It allows communication between devices over wired or wireless media.

---

## 🖥️ Basic Networking Components

- **Host**: Any device connected to a network (e.g., computer, phone).
- **Server**: A device or program that provides services to other devices (clients).
- **Client**: A device or software that requests services from a server.
- **Network**: A group of interconnected devices that communicate and share data.

## 🌐 IP Address

An **IP address (Internet Protocol address)** is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network to enable communication.

### 🔍 Properties of IP Address
- Unique for each device
- Logical address (not hardware-based)
- Consists of Network ID and Host ID

### 🔄 Types of IP Addresses

| Type    | Description                        | Example           |

## 📚 Key Terms

- **Subnetting**: Dividing a large network into smaller subnetworks to improve management and efficiency.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Translates domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.
- **MAC Address (Media Access Control)**: Hardware address unique to each network interface card.
- **Default Gateway**: A router that connects a local network to external networks (like the internet).
- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**: A method of allocating IP addresses and routing that replaces classful addressing (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).

## IP Address Subnetting Calculation

**Given IP Address**: `205.150.65.0/26`  
**CIDR Class**: Class C (`/26` falls under Class C range)

---

1. Subnet Mask:
- CIDR `/26` means 26 bits are used for the network.
- Binary form: `11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000`
- Convert `11000000` (last octet) to decimal:
  - `2⁷ + 2⁶ = 128 + 64 = 192`
- **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.192`

---

2. Number of Subnets:
- Default subnet bits for Class C = 24
- Borrowed subnet bits = `26 - 24 = 2`
- Number of subnets = `2² = 4`

---
3. Number of Hosts:
- Host bits = `32 - 26 = 6`
- Number of hosts per subnet = `2⁶ - 2 = 64 - 2 = 62`
  - (Subtracting 2 for network and broadcast addresses)

---

 4. Network IP:
- Perform AND operation between:
  - IP Address: `205.150.65.0`
  - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.192`
- **Network IP**: `205.150.65.0` (already aligned)

---

5. Broadcast IP:
- Add 62 to the network address:
- **Broadcast IP**: `205.150.65.63`
-

# Networking Commands and Concepts

---

## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

DHCP is a network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration settings to devices in a network. It eliminates the need for manual IP configuration and ensures each device receives a unique IP address within the network.

---

## Common Network Commands

### 1. ping

**Simple Meaning**: Used to check if another device (website, server, or computer) is reachable from your system. It's like asking, "Are you there?" over the network.

**Technical Meaning**: The `ping` command sends ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Echo Request packets to a target host and waits for a reply to confirm connectivity.

- **Syntax**:  ping website_name


- **To stop the command**: Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal or command prompt.

---

### Loopback Address (127.0.0.1)

The IP address `127.0.0.1` always refers to the local computer (your own machine). It is used to test internal networking or TCP/IP configuration.

**Analogy**: Like sending a letter to your own address to test if the mailbox is working.

---

### 2. traceroute / tracert

**Purpose**: Displays the route taken by data packets from your system to a destination server or website, showing each router (hop) it passes through along the way.

- **Command for windows**:tracert [hostname or IP address]


**Note**: Asterisks (`* * *`) in the output mean the router did not respond at that hop.

---

### 3. ipconfig / ifconfig

**ipconfig (Windows)**: Displays the current network configuration, including IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS settings.

- **Syntax**:ipconfig


**ifconfig (macOS/Linux)**: Used to configure and display network interface parameters.

|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LAN**   | Local Area Network; connects devices within a limited area like a home or office. |
| **WAN**   | Wide Area Network; connects networks over large geographical areas, like the internet. |
| **Wi-Fi** | Wireless technology that allows devices to connect to a network without physical cables. |
| **Ethernet** | Wired network technology using cables (usually with RJ-45 connectors) for stable connections. |

- **LAN vs WAN**: LAN is local and private, while WAN is broad and public (e.g., the internet).
- **Wi-Fi vs Ethernet**: Wi-Fi offers convenience and mobility; Ethernet provides faster and more stable connections.

### DAY 9:

### 📄 Introduction to HTML

### 🌐 What is HTML?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create web pages. It defines the structure and layout of a webpage using a system of elements enclosed in tags (e.g., `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<div>`, etc.).

HTML tells the browser **what** content to display, not **how** to style it (that’s what CSS is for).

---

### 🧠 How Browsers Render HTML

When you open a website:

1. **Browser requests the HTML** file from a server.
2. The HTML is parsed **top to bottom** by the browser’s rendering engine.
3. The browser builds the **DOM (Document Object Model)** – a tree-like structure of all elements.
4. It renders content **in order**, applies CSS styles, and then runs JavaScript (if present).
5. Finally, the formatted webpage is displayed to the user.

### 🧱 Basic Structure of an HTML Document

Every HTML page follows a basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Main Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>

```
### 🧱 Structure of an HTML Document

|----------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Document Type  | `<!DOCTYPE html>`      | Declares the HTML version (HTML5), helps the browser render correctly. |
| Root Element   | `<html>`               | Encloses the entire HTML document.                                     |
| Head Section   | `<head>`               | Contains metadata, links to stylesheets, and scripts.                  |
| Page Title     | `<title>`              | Sets the title of the webpage shown in the browser tab.                |
| Body Section   | `<body>`               | Contains all the visible content (text, images, links, etc.).          |
| Headings       | `<h1>` to `<h6>`       | Define headings from most to least important.                          |
| Paragraph      | `<p>`                  | Adds a block of text.                                                  |
| Link           | `<a>`                  | Creates a hyperlink to another page or site.                           |
| Image          | `<img>`                | Embeds an image.                                                       |
| Container      | `<div>` / `<span>`     | Group or style sections of content.                                    |
## DAY 10:
### HTML Tags: Headings, Paragraphs, Lists, Links, Images:

```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<h3>Section Heading</h3>
<h4>Minor Heading</h4>
<h5>Smaller Heading</h5>
<h6>Smallest Heading</h6>

```
###  Paragraphs

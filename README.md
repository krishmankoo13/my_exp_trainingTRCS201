# My Experience in Summer Training by Krish Mankoo
## In this repositry I will share my Experience in 3rd semester training at GNDEC ludhiana
## DAY 1:
### Orientation
The day started with our introduction to our core department - Computer Science and Engineering. Dr Priyanka introduced us with our department and Dr Kiran Jyoti(HOD CSE department) gave us a brief overview about our syllabus scheme.After that we were escorted to our respective labs.
### Learning about Fundametals of linux
Our lab professor then gave us a brief introduction about linux and how to download it.To download linux we required Oracle Virtual Box,Visual C++ Redistribuable Version and Ubuntu Desktop LTS. She helped us understand the applications of it and told us how we can apply it in our future fields.I came to know that linux is used in big companies as it is more secure & open source.We were motivated to also go for startups and other companies along with our studies.I got to know the difference between service-based companies and product-based companies.

After we were explained about booting and its types.Booting, in the context of computers, refers to the process of starting up a computer and loading the operating system.It has two types Cold Boot(eg- Linux and MacOS) and Warm Boot(eg- Windows).After we revised the concepts ourself.

It really motivated and inspired me alot and I was more curious about the upcoming days of training as there are a lot of things for me to learn.

## DAY2:
 Our day started today at 8:30 a.m with a positive mindset and a desire to learn something new.
*“The future belongs to those who prepare for it today.”*
With this thought, we stepped into our labs, ready to absorb and explore the tech world further.
### Kernal and Shell
We were introduced to the core components of the Linux operating system — the Kernel and the Shell.

The Kernel is the heart of the operating system. It directly interacts with the hardware and manages system resources like CPU, memory, and devices. It ensures that each process and application gets the required time and resources to function properly.

The Shell is the interface between the user and the kernel. It interprets the commands we type and communicates them to the kernel.There are four types of shell-Bash,Sh,Zsh and Fish.Butin this training session we used Bash shell.Also there are two types of categories- Command Line Shells and Graphical Shells

## File System Structures
The Linux file system is structured hierarchically, starting from a root directory denoted by /.

## Commands in Linux
The most fun part of today was learning commands in Linux.We learned a lot of basic commands today and had hand's on practice too.Multiple errors also occured but solving them was fun and challenging too.
### Types of Command
whoami: Returns the current domain and user name.
date: Returns current date.
ls (list): Returns content of a specified Directory
cd: Changes directory.
mkdir: Creates a new directory.
pwd: Prints the current working directory.
touch: Creates empty file.
cat: Creates file with content.
whereis: Finds the location of specified file.
cp: To copy content of a file to the other.
mv: To move or rename a file.
whatis: Gives short description of a command.
